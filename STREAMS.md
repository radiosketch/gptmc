what challenge do I need to complete?
	- consider semi autogenerating youtube clickbait memeathons with known actions, and nesting jokes
	- "Minecraft tnt run, but every time I lose i watch 'dont mine at night' mc music video"
	- "Typing speedrun, but every time I misspel a word I complete a spelling game"

challenges to complete while developing livestream assets on-stream:
	- audience sends memes to be added to the notification picker
	- audience gets to mess with me while using blender as a video editor
create a virtual entity to liven up the stream a bit, who takes my speech as input and randomly decides to interject with dumb comments.
	- audience can tell virtual entity what to say
