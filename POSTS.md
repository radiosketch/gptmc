### 2/10/22 : : Beginning Research in Earnest With the Paper from Facebook AI: *[Why Build an Assistant in Minecraft?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09273.pdf)*

#### Part 1: Woah, this has a lot to do with a lot of things I'm interested in. It's time to really dig in, but how can I even digest this much info?
&emsp;I could waffle back and forth about the way I present my ideas _endlessly_, but only because I need somewhere to resume my spontaneous episodes of productivity—without losing any valuable piece of the puzzle I am attempting to complete. I hope that this self-propelled, self-critical research strategy may serve as a better mnemonic than attending years of college courses to achieve the same goal. In essence, I am engineering my very own crash course in communicative, learning, game-playing AI.  
&emsp;Cautious programmers—often labeled pessimistic programmers may suspect that 'game-playing' feels like a behavior that is far too broad to implement because it intertwines a large variety of game strategies. 'Playing' could mean anything I imagine doing in Minecraft, which includes a large amount of creativity that any hopeful configuration of leading-edge algorithms probably couldn't imitate.  
&emsp;My purpose for reading this paper is to document meaningful information that will help me create a similar agent to [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/#research-areas)'s _[CraftAssist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08584.pdf)_ _*with the caveat_ that the agent should be as limited as a human playing the game, and be encouraged to exercise creative freedom as a human would. The information I find in this paper will not specifically answer my burning questions, but I will compile it into a navigable hub for increasingly specific future questions, answers, and implementation strategies.

Questions I want answered eventually:
- How can I put advanced AI agents into Minecraft?
    - Can this be implemented in something as simple as a single Fabric Mod?
- If possible, how should I utilize off-the-shelf models to exhibit the behaviors I have described?
- If it isn't, how should I go about engineering models that are tailored to my parameters?

#### Part 2: What I've gathered from the first few paragraphs.
&emsp;This paper covers the full rationale for creating CraftAssist, and the research program thereof. The purpose of this research program is to make progress on the problems of natural language understanding and learning from dialogue.  
&emsp;In the introduction it describes the most basic concepts that have progressed to eventually achieve the creation of CraftAssist:

- Object Recognition


- Game-Playing


- Generative Models of Images & Text

#### Part 3: Today's Conclusion
&emsp;It doesn't feel like much; however, I'm happy with what I have because it does a better job of explaining my strategy going forward. I've been in need of a true strategy for a while now, so I chose to take the time to reflect and polish my blogging skills in Part 1.  
&emsp;Part 2 was _supposed_ to get through a lot more reading material than it did, but the categories in place should be great for organizing my notes about the paper as I continue.  

Thanks for reading, and hopefully following along,
