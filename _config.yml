# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# title-logo is a new field that, when used, displays a logo
# instead of custom text. Ideally, image is 50px high and takes up
# minimal horizontal space. Tested with a new root "images" folder e.g.:
# title-logo: /images/my-logo.png
title-logo: /images/title-logo.png

# Build settings
# Using regular theme instead
# theme: minima
