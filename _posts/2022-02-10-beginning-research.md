### Taking Notice of the Paper from Facebook AI: *[Why Build an Assistant in Minecraft?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09273.pdf)*

#### Woah, this has a lot to do with a lot of things I'm interested in. It's time to really dig in, but how can I even digest this much info?
&emsp;I could waffle back and forth about the way I present my ideas _endlessly_, but I need somewhere to resume my spontaneous episodes of productivity without losing any valuable information, so here we are! My writing skills probably leave a bit to be desired, so I plan to revise every post to help explain things a little better as I progress through research.  
&emsp;*Researching what exactly?* I've set the goal for myself to create a better AI in Minecraft; if not for the oh-so-precious views, at least to learn more about the field of AI. I hope that this self-propelled, self-critical research strategy may serve as a better mnemonic than attending years of college courses to achieve the same goal. In essence, I'm making my very own crash course in communicative, learning, game-playing AI.  
&emsp;Cautious programmersâ€”often labeled pessimistic programmers may suspect that 'game-playing' feels like a behavior that is far too broad to implement because it intertwines a large variety of game strategies. 'Playing' could mean anything I imagine doing in Minecraft, which includes a large amount of creativity that any hopeful configuration of leading-edge algorithms probably couldn't imitate.  
&emsp;My purpose for reading this paper is to document meaningful information that will help me create a similar agent to [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/#research-areas)'s _[CraftAssist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08584.pdf)_ _*with the caveat_ that the agent should be as limited as a human playing the game, and be encouraged to exercise creative freedom as a human would. The information I find in this paper will not specifically answer my burning questions, but I will compile it into a navigable hub for increasingly specific future questions, answers, and implementation strategies.

Questions I want answered eventually:
- How can I put advanced AI agents into Minecraft?
    - Can this be implemented in something as simple as a single Fabric Mod?
- If possible, how should I utilize off-the-shelf models to exhibit the behaviors I have described?
- If it isn't, how should I go about engineering models that are tailored to my parameters?

Check back soon...ish if you're interested to see what I've learned, and how this changes my conception of a Minecraft mod for high-level AI.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully following along. Check my twitter for smaller, somewhat rare updates.
