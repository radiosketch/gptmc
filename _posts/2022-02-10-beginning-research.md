### Taking Notice of the Paper from Facebook AI: *[Why Build an Assistant in Minecraft?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09273.pdf)*

#### If there were a checklist of my favorite topics, this paper probably crosses off the top 5 entries at least.
&emsp;With over 100 references ranging from [*Minecraft*](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-02-minecraft-exceeds-90-million-monthly-active-users) to [*Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00103), this paper looks delicious enough to devour, but I'm beginning to feel like Melinda Mae, the girl who ate a monstrous whale, the longer I look at it. The rabbit hole of information just goes deeper and deeper from here. One question needs answering above many: **why** do I plan to digest this much information?  
&emsp;Minecraft's creatures (mobs) are exceedingly boring; in the simplest case they just wander aimlessly and make a noise once in a while. As a biased human, I can understand how randomly wandering pigs and cows are a reasonable-enough simulation of the real thing, but Villagers, their Illager counterparts, and even Piglins seem ripe for an upgrade in the intelligence department.  
&emsp;I want to see if creating intelligent mobs in Minecraft is at least possible; if not for the oh-so-precious views, at least to learn more about the field of AI. While I progress through dense academic papers, I'll need somewhere to resume my spontaneous episodes of productivity without losing any valuable information, so here we are reading this wonderful blog! My writing skills probably leave a bit to be desired, so I plan to revise posts as I go along.  
&emsp;My purpose for reading this particular paper is to document meaningful information that will help me create a similar agent to [Facebook AI's](https://ai.facebook.com/research/#research-areas) [CraftAssist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08584.pdf) *with the caveat* that the agent should be as limited as a human playing the game, and be encouraged to exercise creative freedom as a human would. The information I find in this paper will not specifically answer my burning questions, but I will compile it into a navigable hub for increasingly specific future questions, answers, and implementation strategies.

Questions I want answered eventually:
- How can I put advanced AI agents into Minecraft?
    - Can this be implemented in something as simple as a single Fabric Mod?
- If possible, how should I utilize off-the-shelf models to exhibit the behaviors I have described?
- If it isn't, how should I go about engineering models that are tailored to my parameters?

Check back soon...ish if you're interested to see what I've learned, and how this changes my conception of a Minecraft mod for high-level AI.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully following along. Check my twitter for smaller, somewhat rare updates.
