        pay respects to the cat <br>
        as you walk past <br>

<!--        your favorite doorman-->
<!--        purring comfortingly-->
<!--        closing your eyes befriendingly-->

        he's on the payroll <br>
        you pay him your touch <br>
        a touch of your soul <br>
        your toll <br>

    <!--    [comment]: <> (for his comforting aura <br>)-->

    <!--    [comment]: <> (is your comforting mast)-->

        for one sad day <br>
        when he's passed <br>
        he may not give it back <br>

    <!--[comment]: <> (his meals do not assuage him <br>)-->

    <!--[comment]: <> (your remains are poor <br>)-->

    <!--[comment]: <> (he'll have your soul <br>)-->
